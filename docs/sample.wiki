This is where the content starts. Just like SMTP and HTTP.

The goal of this format is to be as web-friendly and simple as possible. I was
going to go for some sort of XML-based format, but the effort in parsing that
would have been a big pain in the butt. In the future it might make sense to
keep everything as XML files and just have the UI editing that. But for now
we'll stick with the wiki formatting and I'll push a bunch of junk in this doc
that looks like it was pulled straight from a web server's socket buffer.

== Headers ==
Each header ends with a newline character, with keys and values being delimited
with a colon followed by any amount of whitespace. The header block ends with
two consecutive newlines.

=== Author ===
Author is the most recent author of this page. It's kind of like a capture the
flag sort of situation with whomever made the last edit being on top.

=== Last-Modified ===
In the interest of saving myself some effort, the date is stored as a Unix
timestamp at UTC, then we convert as necessary
